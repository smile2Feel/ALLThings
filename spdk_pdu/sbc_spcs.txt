1. sg_read
Read data from a Linux SCSI generic (sg) device, a block device or a normal file with each read command issued to the same offset or logi‐
cal  block  address (lba). This can be used to test (or time) disk caching, SCSI (or some other) transport throughput, and/or SCSI command
overhead.

sg_read if=/dev/sg0 bs=512 count=1MB mmap=1 time=2
Time from second read command to end was 0.027182 secs, 18833.58 MB/sec
Average number of read commands per second was 287432.86
1000000+0 records in, read commands issued: 7813

2. sg_sync
Send  SYNCHRONIZE  CACHE(10)  or  SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(16) command to DEVICE.
If successful these commands make sure that any blocks whose latest versions
are held in cache are written to (also termed as "synchronized with") the medium.

sg_sync /dev/sdg

3. sg_readcap
The normal action of the SCSI READ CAPACITY command is to fetch the number of blocks (and block size) from the DEVICE.
The READ CAPACITY(16) response provides additional information not found in the READ CAPACITY(10) response.

sg_readcap /dev/sdg
sg_readcap -16 /dev/sdg

Logical block provisioning: lbpme=1, lbprz=0（该字段不一样）

4. sg_scan
If no DEVICE names are given, sg_scan does a scan of the sg devices and outputs a line of information for each sg device that is currently bound to a SCSI device.

sg_scan /dev/sdg

5. sg_raw
send arbitrary SCSI command to a device.

sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sdg 12 00 00 00 60 00
SCSI Status: Good
Received 96 bytes of data:

6. sg_start
send SCSI START STOP UNIT command: start, stop, load or eject medium

sg_start --stop /dev/sdm
sg_start --start /dev/sdm

7. sg_map/sg_map26
displays mapping between Linux sg and other SCSI devices.

sg_map
/dev/sg0
/dev/sg1  /dev/sda
/dev/sg2  /dev/sdb

sg_map26 /dev/sdg
/dev/sg7

8.sg_modes(todo)
This utility sends a MODE SENSE SCSI command to the DEVICE and outputs the response.

sg_modes /dev/sdm
    IET       VIRTUAL-DISK  0001   peripheral_type: disk [0x0]
Mode parameter header from MODE SENSE(10):
  Mode data length=110, medium type=0x00, WP=0, DpoFua=1, longlba=0

不支持：
1. sg_opcodes 
The default action is to report supported operation codes.
sg_opcodes --op=93h /dev/sdb
sg_opcodes --tmf -n /dev/sdb
sg_opcodes -an /dev/sdb

2. sg_prevent
Sends  a SCSI PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL command to DEVICE.  The default action of this utility is to prevent the removing or ejecting of the medium from a drive. This is done by ignoring the SCSI START STOP UNIT command (see sg_start) and ignoring the eject button on the drive when the user presses it. Drives that  hold  removable  disks,  tape  cartridges or cd/dvd media typically implement this command. 

sg_prevent /dev/sdg

3. sg_rtpg(todo)
send SCSI REPORT TARGET PORT GROUPS command.

sg_rtpg /dev/sdm
Report target port groups:
  target port group id : 0x0 , Pref=0, Rtpg_fmt=0
    target port group asymmetric access state : 0x00
    T_SUP : 1, O_SUP : 1, LBD_SUP : 0, U_SUP : 1, S_SUP : 1, AN_SUP : 1, AO_SUP : 1
    status code : 0x00
    vendor unique status : 0x00
    target port count : 01
    Relative target port ids:
      0x03

4.sg_verify(todo)
Sends one or more SCSI VERIFY (10 or 16) commands to DEVICE. These SCSI commands are defined in the SBC-2 (draft) standard at http://www.t10.org and SBC-3 drafts.

No news is good news (i.e. if there are no verify errors detected then no  messages  are  sent  to
stderr and the Unix exit status is 0).

其他：
sg_senddiag 均不支持(todo)
sg_senddiag --pf --raw=- /dev/sdm < sdiag_sas_p1_cjtpat.txt
SEND DIAGNOSTIC command, failed
  try again with '-vv' for more information
sg_senddiag failed: Illegal request
